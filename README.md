# Face-Reconstruction
Reconstruct the faces from the given database using Mean face, Eigen faces and Covariance Matrix.
• Load and plot a database of faces: use the faces.mat file or create your own
• Calculate and plot the mean face
• Calculate the covariance matrix C
• Calculate the eigenvectors and eigenvalues of C, and plot the eigenvectors (eigenfaces)
• Reconstruct the faces using only six eigenvectors
  o Plot the reconstructed faces
• Reconstruct the faces using only three eigenvectors
  o Plot the reconstructed faces
